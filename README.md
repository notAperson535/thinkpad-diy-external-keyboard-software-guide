# Some things I have found about the "SwUpdate" software used to program Thinkpad Classic Keyboard to USBC converter boards
This is by no means a definitive guide.
The translations are a bit messy.
In general just click the buttons at the locations they are in the images.
Images were obtained from the files I recieved.

Circuit boards like this:<img width="1588" height="1150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eb14e75-05ad-429f-824d-dacc8ccfb1b9" />
Although they could be different colors

I was able to acquire both the software and basic instructions on how to use it. Those can be found [here](https://github.com/notAperson535/notAperson535/blob/main/TP%20wired%20keyboards%20(supports%20Mac%20firmware).zip)

There are two options.

1. Find a compatible .cfg file for your keyboard
   - For some reason these were sorted into two folders, the software folder and the "Other profiles" folder. Check both to find the proper one. Also remember some keyboard are compatible with multiple different devices, so if you have a t420 keyboard the config might just the x220 or similar.

3. Follow the instructions in the word doc to create your own .cfg file (I would recommend copying one of the generic ones for this).

Follow the instructions in the image to flash the .cfg file onto your keyboard

Black box with text should be pointing to "download config" button. Ignore step 4 unless you have a bluetooth supported circuit.

I am not sure what the "prep", "step 1", and "step 2" images are, I just included them because they came with the files.
